# Citation Chaining

`Citation chaining` is a powerful search strategy that allows you to move backwards and forwards through a research topic.

When using `citation chaining`, you can find historic, current, and related research as well as identify how a topic has changed over time.

## Backward citation chaining

`Backward citation chaining` refers to using the reference list from a relevant source to discover additional related sources.
* When reading a source (article, book, etc.), make note of cited sources related to your topic
* Find the sources in the reference list, footnotes, endnotes, etc.
* Find the full-text of the source
  * Journal article: Follow the instructions on <a href="https://jylisadoney.github.io/soc/3-journals.html#find-a-journal-in-the-library-catalog" target="_blank">finding a specific journal in the Library catalog</a>  
  * Book/book chapter: Search the <a href ="https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/?_ga=2.8463987.734477797.1519142255-1596890762.1509730084" target="_blank">Library catalog </a>to see if we have access
