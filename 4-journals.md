# Search in Specific Journals

When doing research, it can often be helpful to start your search within specific journals that are related to your topic or discipline. The following step-by-step instructions will help you [identify](#identify-disciplinary-journals), [find](#find-a-journal-in-the-library-catalog), and [search within a disciplinary journal](#search-within-a-disciplinary-journal).

## Identify disciplinary journals
* Visit the <a href="https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/" target="_blank">University of Idaho Library website</a>
* Click on `Databases` below the search box
* In the drop-down box, scroll to and select `InCites Journal Citation Reports`
* Click on go
* On the new page, click on `Browse by Category`
* On the new page, click on `Journals by Rank`
* Click on `Select Categories`
* Scroll down to and check the box for a specific discipline
  * Example: Sociology
* Scroll down and click on `Submit` at the bottom of the page

You can now see a ranked list of journals within a specific discipline. Journals in this list are ranked based on the number of times their articles are cited by other articles.
