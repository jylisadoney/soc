# Search in Specific Journals

When doing research, it can often be helpful to start your search within specific journals that are related to your topic or discipline. 

The following step-by-step instructions will help you [identify](#identify-disciplinary-journals), [find](#find-a-journal-in-the-library-catalog), and [search](#search-within-a-disciplinary-journal) within a disciplinary journal. You can even learn how to [confirm](#confirm-if-a-journal-is-peer-reviewed) if a journal is peer-reviewed.

## Identify disciplinary journals
* Visit the <a href="https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/" target="_blank">University of Idaho Library website</a>
* Click on `Databases` below the search box
* In the drop-down box, scroll to and select `InCites Journal Citation Reports`
* Click on go
* On the new page, click on `Browse by Category`
* On the new page, click on `Journals by Rank`
* Click on `Select Categories`
* Scroll down to and check the box for a specific discipline
  * Example: Sociology
* Scroll down and click on `Submit` at the bottom of the page

You can now see a ranked list of journals within a specific discipline. Journals in this list are ranked based on the number of times their articles are cited by other articles.

## Find a journal in the library catalog
Once we find a list of disciplinary journals and identify one you are interested in, we need to see if the University of Idaho Library has full-text access to articles.

* Visit the <a href="https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/" target="_blank">University of Idaho Library website</a>
* Click on `Journals` below the search box
* On the new page, type the `journal name` into the search box
  * Example: Sociology Compass
* Click on go or hit enter on your keyboard
* On the new page, click the journal title that provides `Online Access`
* Under `View It`, click the link that provides the access you need (current/historic articles)
* Enter your `Vandal NetID` if prompted 

## Search within a disciplinary journal
* Complete the 'Find a journal' steps
* On the new page, type your `keywords` into the search box
  * Example: vaccines AND opinions AND trust
    * Visit the <a href="https://jylisadoney.github.io/soc/1-syntax.html#search-syntax" target="_blank">Search Syntax page</a> to learn more about `AND`
* If prompted, select the option to search in `This Journal` only
* Click on search or hit enter on your keyboard
* Browse the results 
* Click on an article you are interested in
* Read the article online or download the PDF  

If we don't have the full-text of an article you need, request it for **free** via <a href ="https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/services/ill/" target="_blank">Interlibrary Loan</a>.

## Confirm if a journal is peer-reviewed
Once you select a journal, you can use a library database to confirm that it is peer-reviewed.

* Visit the <a href="https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/" target="_blank">University of Idaho Library website</a>
* Click on `Databases` below the search box
* In the drop-down box, scroll to and select `Ulrichsweb Global Serials Directory`
* On the new page, type the `journal name` into the search box
  * Example: Sociology Compass
* Click on the magnifying glass
* On the new page, identify the correct journal
* If the journal has a 'referee jersey' next to its name, it is a peer-reviewed journal
